There are a variety of pros to using ChatGPT to code. For one, it increases coding efficiency. Instead of spending time planning on how you will start implementing a feature, you can use ChatGPT to give you a direction. Also, you can find the answers to your questions much faster than by googling.
However, there are also some cons to using ChatGPT. A common issue is buggy or inaccurate code. Therefore, you will have to spend more time debugging than you might typically spend when writing the code yourself. It is also limited in the amount of code that can be generated. The larger the request, the more likely ChatGPT will not be able to deliver.
